**Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, there lived an alien kitty with a love for adventure!**

Kitty cherished every moment spent with her parents, exploring the cosmos together. But one fateful day, Kitty woke up to find her parents missing, leaving behind a mysterious note:

> "Hey Kitty! We've gone to explore a planet called EARTH. We've heard its vast ocean is really cool. Meet us there!"

Whoa, talk about a surprise! But if there's one thing Kitty loves, it's a spontaneous trip. And guess what? Kitty has a super cool alien power – the ability to make waves! 🌊💥 These waves will keep her safe from whatever lurks in the deep blue sea.

Enough chit-chat. Let’s make some waves and dive into the ocean! 🌊🐾
